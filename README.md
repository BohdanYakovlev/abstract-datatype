#  Stack, Queue, and Double-ended Queue Operations

This Go code demonstrates basic operations on a stack, queue, and double-ended queue (deque). It defines the necessary data structure and functions to perform operations like adding elements, removing elements, and printing the structure.

## How to Run the Code

To run this console app, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Go code:

```
cd abstract-datatype

```

3. Ensure you have Go installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

4. Execute the Go code by running the following command:

```
go run main.go
```
## Overview of Operations

The code provides the following operations:

- Stack operations:
  - `stackAdd`: Add an element to the top of the stack.
  - `stackRem`: Remove an element from the top of the stack.
  
- Queue operations:
  - `queueAdd`: Add an element to the end of the queue.
  - `queueRem`: Remove an element from the front of the queue.

- Double-ended queue (Deque) operations:
  - `decPushFront`: Add an element to the front of the deque.
  - `decPushBack`: Add an element to the end of the deque.
  - `decPopFront`: Remove an element from the front of the deque.
  - `decPopBack`: Remove an element from the end of the deque.

## Conclusion

This code provides a basic implementation of stack, queue, and deque operations in Go. These data structures are fundamental in computer science and find applications in various algorithms and problem-solving scenarios. By understanding and using these operations, developers can efficiently manage and manipulate data in their programs.
